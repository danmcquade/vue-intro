## What did you choose this subject

- Doing some initial research this morning, it looks like Vue.js is growing rapidly in popularity, and it would probably be a good idea to have some hands-on experience with it.

## What problem does it solve?

- Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue was designed to be incrementally adoptable. Vue is intended to be easy to integrate into projects that use other JavaScript libraries. My goal with this project was to deploy a simple portfolio page with independent, reusable components, and Vue.js handled this task nicely.

## Why does one use it?

-Some of that primary advantages of Vue are that it is lightweight, component-based, and the core library is intended primarily for building user interfaces.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
